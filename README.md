# Simple Image Processing with OpenCV

This project demonstrates basic image processing tasks using Python and OpenCV, such as reading an image, detecting primary colors, converting to grayscale, and more.

## Setup and Run

1. **Clone this repository or download the project files.**

2. **Install Required Libraries**

    Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Running the Script**

    To run the script, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and execute:

    ```bash
    python OpenCV.py
    ```

    Ensure you have an image file named `image.jpg` in the project directory or modify the `image_path` variable in the script to point to your image file.

### Additional Notes:

- This README is designed to be straightforward, focusing on the basic steps to get the project running.
- You might want to adjust the filename `OpenCV.py` if your script is named differently.
